ARTH-actionable rural trade hub 
# ARTH – Smart Market Access Platform for Farmers

ARTH is a web-based platform designed to help small and marginal farmers
make informed selling decisions by providing reliable, mandi-level price
is decision-support platform that helps farmers choose the most practical nearby market to sell their produce,
using verified mandi-level price data combined with location intelligence.Our solution is a farmer-friendly website that provides real-time, location-specific mandi prices for fruits and vegetables only within the farmer’s reachable distance.
The platform helps farmers compare prices across nearby mandis and choose where and when to sell for better returns.
The platform uses verified government-linked market data and trusted sources to provide real-time, mandi-wise prices without altering original data.
Prices are source-backed, market-wise, and unbiased, building farmer confidence and reducing dependence on middlemen.
The platform focuses on simplicity, trust, and accessibility, especially
for farmers in rural regions.

**#problem **
Small and marginal farmers cultivating fruits and vegetables do not have access to reliable, real-time and location-specific mandi price information for nearby markets. 
Since fruits and vegetables are highly perishable,even small daily price fluctuations across mandis significantly affect farmers’ income and selling decisions.
Agriculture supports a large portion of India’s population, and fruits and vegetables form a major share of perishable agricultural trade. Inefficiencies in price discovery reduce rural incomes,
increase dependence on intermediaries, and slow down equitable agricultural growth.
In India, farmers selling fruits and vegetables face frequent price
fluctuations across mandis. Due to the lack of real-time, location-specific
price visibility, farmers often sell produce at nearby mandis without
knowing if better prices are available within a reasonable travel distance.

Existing government platforms provide price data but often lack usability,
actionable insights, and clear decision support for farmers.

## Proposed Solution

ARTH enables farmers to:
- View verified mandi-level prices for selected crops
- Compare prices based on how far they can travel
- Decide where to sell to maximize returns

The platform avoids village-level pricing to maintain data reliability and
focuses only on trusted mandi sources.

• Technologies Used: Programming languages, frameworks, blockchain platform, databases, cloud services, or hardware (if any).
• System Architecture: High-level  ow of frontend, backend, blockchain layer, and integrations.
• Implementation Methodology: Step-by-step approach to build the solution (phased development).
• Process Flow: Simple  ow chart or diagram showing how data moves through the system.
• Prototype Plan: What will be built in the prototype / MVP phase (no full implementation required yet).

## How ARTH Works (Current Design)

1. Farmer selects the crop
2. Farmer enters maximum travel distance
3. System filters nearby mandis within the distance
4. Prices are displayed in a simple, easy-to-understand format
5. Farmer chooses the best mandi based on price and feasibility

## Current Progress – Phase 2

- Frontend prototype built using HTML
- Basic UI showcasing problem, solution, and sample mandi prices
- Backend structure planned using Node.js and Express and json 
- Mock mandi price data created for demonstration
- Core workflow demonstrated (proof of concept)
- we have submitted the codes of both frontend and backend(use of api key),but we just need to coneect them to get the real data for our website.this is pending only

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML (prototype UI)
- Backend: Node.js, Express (planned / partially implemented)
- Version Control: GitHub
- Data Source (Planned): Government mandi data (eNAM / APMC)

---

## Innovation & Uniqueness

- Focus on distance-based decision-making for farmers
- Simple and minimal interface (no information overload)
- Emphasis on data trust by using mandi-level sources only
- Designed for future voice-based and regional language support

---

## Scalability & Ministry Alignment

- Aligned with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare initiatives
- Designed to integrate with national mandi data platforms
- Scalable across states, crops, and regions
- Web-based architecture allows easy nationwide deployment

---

## Future Roadmap

- API integration with live mandi price sources
- Distance calculation using maps
- Voice input and regional language support
- Farmer-friendly mobile-first UI
- Secure data handling and authentication

## Note

This project is currently in the prototype and learning phase as part of
INNOVIT 2026 Phase 2. The focus is on demonstrating understanding, system
design, and implementation capability rather than final perfection.
